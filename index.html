            <h2>Quotes that inspire me</h2> <br>
            <p>1. "Sorry " <br>
                Works when a mistake is made, <br> but not when a trust is broken. <br> So, in life make mistakes but never <br> break a trust. Becuase forgiving is <br> easy but forgetting and trusting <br> again is sometimes impossible <br>
                - Nayan Ranjan Sinha<br>
                2. When "I" is <br> Replaced by "we", <br> Then even illness <br> becomes wellness.<br>
